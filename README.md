# UploadOfTimeline
Upload of activities to the Timeline in Gainsight

The automation will first ask you whether you have a template Excel file
If you don't, click on 'No' and specify the directory where you want a sample template file to be copied

Once you have filled the sample file with all the Timeline data that you want to upload, please start by authenticating to Gainsight on chrome. Then just start the automation, select 'Yes' when asked if you already have a template Excel file and select the Excel file that you have completed.

The robot will then process each row of the Excel file and create a new Meeting event (sorry only Meetings at the moment, but could be extended in later versions), input all of the data and save the event.
